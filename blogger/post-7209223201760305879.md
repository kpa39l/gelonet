Social advertising currently has the box seat with driving traffic, especially with the increase in mobile users over desktop. Hotels are seeing traffic on mobile now exceeding desktop with mobile revenue beginning to follow the same pattern. The top referral for many hotels is Facebook, the traffic referral is coming from Sponsored and Boosted posts, as well as Organic. A key aspect to identify is that Boosted and Organic are only seen by people who follow your page, where as Sponsored posts are audience driven, based on a target market for a specific campaign you’re running. Meaning if your following is small, or your offering doesn’t have a strong track record of repeat bookings via Facebook, then your best bet is Sponsored advertising.
